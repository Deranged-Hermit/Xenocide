                <h1>Guild Rules</h1>
                <p>All members of the guild, regardless of rank, are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct governs all interactions between guild members and other people, either within the guild or outside. This Code of Conduct applies to all members and all means of communication without exception.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Breaches of the Code of Conduct will result in disciplinary action from the Guild Leadership appropriate to the player's rank and the nature of the breach.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
                
                <div class="list-background">
                <ul>
                <li>All guild members are expected to be respectful and polite when dealing with other members of the community. Griefing, interfering with other players, and otherwise being a jerk is not permitted.</li>
                <li>Humor is welcome! If someone is offended by a joke, apologize and move on; if you're offended, state that and then move on. There's no need to go into depth on the matter.</li>
                <li>The following topics are off-limits in general guild chat:</li>
                <li>Adult language in guild chat is permitted. If you do not care to see it we encourage you to turn on the mature language filter in game.</li>
                <li>All players are expected to treat officers and other guild members with respect and politeness.</li>
                <li>Respect others. Treat all other players with dignity and respect. Be respectful of other members of the guild, their abilities, their contributions, and any extra duties they perform to keep the guild running.</li>
                <li>Immature and infantile behaviour is not tolerated. This is a guild of adults, so make sure you act like it.</li>
                <li>Not everyone will get on with everyone else. That's life.</li>
                <li>Not everyone will agree with everyone else. Its a large guild and conflict will inevitably arise. As adults, members are expected to either try to resolve disagreements with other players civilly, privately and independently. Failing that, try to work around it. Approach an Officer for assistance if you have exhausted all other options.</li>
                <li>Drama will not be tolerated. Disagreements or other behaviours which become disruptive are unacceptable.</li>
                <li>Guild rules will inevitably change over time. Members are expected to accept and adhere to new rules regardless of their personal opinions. Be mindful that the Guild Leadership tries to make decisions that are best for the guild as a whole and for the long term, which may not necessarily correspond to the best decision for you personally right now.</li>
                <li>Constructive feedback and discussion on all aspects of the guild and raiding is always welcome. Complaints should not be made unless accompanied by alternative proposals. All feedback and discussion should respect this Code of Conduct.</li>
                <li>Do not engage in any activity that will bring the guild's name into disrepute. Behaviours such as spamming, trolling, ninjaing, begging, flaming, or other anti-social actions are not acceptable.</li>
                <li>Abusive, threatening, discriminatory, or prejudicial behaviour of any form is expressly forbidden and will be met with immediate expulsion from the guild. Intentionally vexatious, obstructive, malicious, hostile, aggressive, or insulting behaviour is not acceptable.</li>
              </ul>

              </br>
                
                <h2>Officers</h2>
                Your officers are:
                <ul>
                        <li>Danny</li>
						<li>JackKnife</li>
                        <li>Ash</li>
                        <li>Hippo</li>
                        <li>Antreas</li>
                        <li>Borntorun</li>
                        <li>Cissa</li>
                        <li>Ragnok</li>
                        <li>Shinyaiba</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Officers are appointed based upon experience, ability, and trustworthiness over time. While officers have authority over other guild members, they are not "superior" to other members and should not be considered as such. The officers are subject to the same rules as other members.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you have a problem with one of the officers, please report it to another officer promptly. This includes situations wherein an officer makes you uncomfortable or appears to be violating the rules of the guild for any reason. We strive for transparency and accountability, but we don't always succeed; let us know if we make mistakes so we can correct them in the future.</p>
            
                </br>
                
                <h2>Punishments</h2>
                <p>Violating the rules of the guild is something that we take seriously, as it can lead to hard feelings and damage overall group cohesion. In the event that someone is violating the rules of the guild, we will investigate the matter and take appropriate action, whether the player in question is an officer or not.</p>
            <br>
                <p>In the event that someone is behaving contrary to the rules, the first step is a discussion with the player in question and a notification that there is a problem. No further action will be taken, and if nothing else happens within a month the entire thing can be forgotten.</p>
            <br>
                <p>A separate or continuing incident requires further steps. Someone who is consistently behaving contrary to the guild rules will be assigned a probationary rank with limited privileges for a month's time pending any further behavior violations. Further behavior issues will be dealt with via removal from the guild.</p>
            <br>
                <p>If someone is removed from the guild due to inactivity, they may reapply and rejoin the guild with no penalty whatsoever. If someone is removed from the guild due to behavior violations, they will not be permitted to reapply in the future.</p>
                
              </br>
            
                <h2>Raiding</h2>
                <h3>Raid Preperation</h3>
                <div class="list-background">
                <ul>
                  <li>Required Addons: DBM or Bigwigs</li>
                  <li>You must sign the in-game calendar for every raid 48 hours before. Any planned absences to be posted on the forums. Accepting a calendar invite and then not showing up is unacceptable.</li>
                  <li>If you will be late, please notify us on discord using your mobile phone.</li>
                  <li>You should turn up with enough consumables for an entire raid, these include flasks, food, runes and potions.</li>
                  <li>We expect all of your gear to have the best enchants and gems.</li>
                  <li>Significant preparation for new bosses we face by researching new encounters and reading our forums and discord announcements before each raid.</li>
                  <li>We use discord to raid. A working headset and willingness to communicate is key.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            
              <br>
            
                <h3>Performance</h3>
                <div class="list-background">
                <ul>
                  <li>We do not tolerate mid raid AFKs or being late back from breaks. We always have a 10 minute break half way through the raid.</li>
                  <li>Having a stable connection and machine capable of running raids without difficulities is a must.</li>
                  <li>We rotate our roster fairly to ensure everyone plays a key role in the guilds overall progression.</li>
                  <li>Follow instructions given by the raid leader and contribute with any ideas you may have.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            
                <h3>Attendance</h3>
                <p>All players are expected to show up before guild events at least ten minutes before the designated start time. That doesn't mean you need to be in the right spot and waiting for ten minutes, but you should be online and have any and all prerequisite content completed beforehand.</p>
            <br>
                <p>In the event that you fail to complete prerequisite content before an event, the organizer and/or officers have the right to remove you from the group and bring someone else. Similarly, if you are more than ten minutes late to a guild event, the organizer and/or officers have the right to start the event without you and not permit you to join after the fact. Consistently signing up for events and showing up late is considered a violation of guild rules.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Members are expected to be online at least once per week for at least a brief period. If circumstances will require you to be offline for an extended period of time, notify an officer ahead of time if you can. Without notifications, older characters will be removed from the guild for inactivity.</p>
