    <div class="main-container">
        <main>
                <h1 class="center" >Guild Rules</h1>


            <h2 class="center">Raiding</h2>
            <article>
              <p>The following rules below are designed to provide clarity and understanding about what is expected from each and every Initiate, Member, and Officer of Xenocide. These rules are subject to change as the High Council sees fit.</p>
              <p>Raid Times: Tuesday and Wednesday from 7pm -9pm. Friday and Saterday from 7:00pm - 9:00pm. Sign-ups through the in-game calendar.</p>

              <h3>Raid Types</h3>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>Fun Raids: These are timewalking raids, old transmog runs, and normal runs for undergeared or new players. It is up to the raid leader what if any of the rules below apply.</li>
                <li>Progression Raid: This refers to the prgression of the current tier. Once a difficulty has been cleared we will start on the next difficulty. In this case all of the below rules apply.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Attendance</h3>
              <p>All players are expected to show up before guild events at least ten minutes before the designated start time. That doesn't mean you need to be in the right spot and waiting for ten minutes, but you should be online and have any and all prerequisite content completed beforehand.</p>
              <p>In the event that you fail to complete prerequisite content before an event, the organizer and/or officers have the right to remove you from the group and bring someone else. Similarly, if you are more than ten minutes late to a guild event, the organizer and/or officers have the right to start the event without you and not permit you to join after the fact. Consistently signing up for events and showing up late is considered a violation of guild rules.</p>
              <p>The required attendance for the Raider rank is at least 80% over the last 6 resets. Dropping below 80% for that period (last 6 resets) will result to immediate demote to member.</p>
              <p>We understand that real life emergencies may come up during the raid, and that these emergencies would not count negatively against you. Abuse of the real life emergency exception will be dealt with accordingly.</p>

              <h3>Required Software</h3>
              <p>If you need help installing any of these addons, please ask either on the forums, Discord or in guild chat.</p>
              
              <h4>Discord</h4>
              <p>Blizzard has created more boss encounters that require everyone to communicate.</p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>Have Discord installed and being able to talk and to listen to your raid leader</li>
                <li>While we are relaxed on Discord, excessive chatter or banter is not accepted during raids. If you fail to do so may result to your removal from the raid.</li>
                <li>Make sure push-to-talk is enabled. Push-to-talk is mandatory in most of our channels. Refusal to do so may result to your removal from the raid or the guild.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Boss Mods</h4>
              <p>There are two that are used by different people in the guild. Big Wigs tendsto have more accurate timers. Deadly Boss Mods has more timers for different events. Please only run one of these addons not both.</p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/big-wigs">Big Wigs</a> </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/deadly-boss-mods">Deadly Boss Mods</a> </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Suggested Software</h3>
              <p></p>
              <h4>Weak Auras</h4>
              <p>We highly suggest using Weak Auras and in some cases may require it on some bosses or for some roles.</p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2">Weak Auras</a> </li>
                <li><a href="https://wago.io/GrbGKhzKH">Azsharas Decree Helper</a> </li>
                <li> <a href="https://wago.io/AzsharaWidget">Queen Azshara UI Widget panel</a> </li>
                <li><a href="https://wago.io/vXjZZYnUh">Eternal Palace Tanks Auras</a> </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Enchants/Gems</h3>
              <p>Everyone that’s in the raid with you wants progress/less wipes, make sure your gear is as good as it can be.</p>
              <p>We use <a href=""></a> and <a href=""></a> to evaluate your gear, if you’re missing talents, top quality enchants or top quality gems, you may be removed from the raidteam without further notice. The level of enchants and gems we’ll be expecting is best available, no matter how low the level of an item is.</p>

              <h3>Consumables</h3>
              <p>The guild will provide Cauldrons, Flasks, Potions, Food and Tomes, but you are always expected to have the best available quality of:</p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>Flasks – 2 per raid</li>
                <li>Food – 2 stacks per raid</li>
                <li>DPS Potions – 20 per raid</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Loot</h3>
              <p>In Xenociide loot is seen as a means to reach our goal, not a goal in itself. All loot is personal loot to do with as you please. The guild does not control or direct loot distribution.</p>
              <p>When players want unwanted loot items to be distributed, the items are linked to the Master Looter.</p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>The Master Looter announces each item, and any player interested in that item is invited to roll (/roll).</li>
                <li>The player with the highest roll wins the item.</li>
                <li>In the case of tied highest rolls, the tied players re-roll for that item until one player wins.</li>
                <li>Any items unwanted by the raid that are able to be Disenchanted will be, and the shards will be sent to the Guild Bank.</li>
                <li>Any player that roles on items they do not need will be removed from the raid and demoted to member.</li>
            </ul>
