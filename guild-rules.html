                <h1 class="center" >Guild Rules</h1>
                <p>All members of the guild, regardless of rank, are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct governs all interactions between guild members and other people, either within the guild or outside. This Code of Conduct applies to all members and all means of communication without exception.</p>
                <p>Guild rules will inevitably change over time. Members are expected to accept and adhere to new rules regardless of their personal opinions. Be mindful that the Guild Leadership tries to make decisions that are best for the guild as a whole and for the long term, which may not necessarily correspond to the best decision for you personally right now.</p>
                
                <h2 class="center rank">Code of Conduct</h2>
                <article>
<ul class="list">
    <img class="rules-img" src="./img/rules-2.png" alt="illidan">
  <li>We expect all members to ensure that all actions they take are done in the mindset of 'guild first'. Anything a member does reflects on the overall guild image and on all fellow members. We expect members to only take actions that reflect positively on the guild image that we have worked very hard to build and maintain.</li>
  <li>Adult language in guild chat is permitted. If you do not care to see it we encourage you to turn on the mature language filter in game. If you intend to use adult language or topics in Discord please use the 18+ lobby.</li>
  <li>Members are expected to be online at least once per week for at least a brief period. If circumstances will require you to be offline for an extended period of time, notify an officer ahead of time if you can. Without notifications, older characters will be removed from the guild for inactivity.</li>
  <li>Guild chat may at times get rude and you are asked to have a thick skin and not to take offense at things that are meant as a joke. However, cruel comments and sexual harassment to another player will not be tolerated.  if you're offended, state that and then move on. There's no need to go into depth on the matter.</li>
  <li>You will not harass, beg or complain to get people for your group, about being power leveled, teleported, resurrected, given loot, get enchants or items crafted. These things are not your rights, but your privileges. If a member or the guild decides to help you in this way, that is that member’s decision. You cannot demand it from your guild mates.</li>
  <li>If you’re a hothead and like to argue and have verbal fights then this is not the right guild for you. We don’t go looking for fights. We avoid them and we always seek to resolve issues in a mature way. Looking for fights is a sign of immaturity and we do not appreciate it.</li>
  <li>No one likes spam. Don’t do it. People will put you on ignore lists and it will reflect badly on the guild! This counts for macro’s, spamming trade channel and other spam. Obviously, the same counts for scamming. </li>
  <li>Understanding that the game revolves around rewards we expect a sober attitude towards loot and everything related to it. Especially in raids we expect players to use their heads when rolling on items. Take into account who else might need the item and even think about passing it so someone else can have it. Passing loot for others is highly appreciated!</li>
  <li>The guild bank most of the times is willing to sell items to members at 50% of the current AH price. This is intended for upgrading/enhancing your own gear, professions, utility, etc. When you buy items from the guild bank you are NOT allowed to re-sell them on the Auction House. This rule is meant to help out people and give them some slack when leveling professions or gearing up for a raid. </li>
</ul>
<p>You may request a change in guild policy, rules or anything else related to the guild. To do so, you need to post a poll on the forums. If at least 30% of the guilds members vote, and 70% or more are in favor, then the requested change is accepted. The poll closes in 5 days. Complaints should not be made unless accompanied by alternative proposals. All feedback and discussion should respect this Code of Conduct. </p>



<h2 class="center rank">Conflict Resolution</h2>

  <p>If you have any issues with other members of the guild, or other players, you will discuss those problems with the other person first. Do not bring issues to the officers unless you absolutely require mediation. We are all adults here and it is the belief of this guild that we can handle our own disagreements.</p>
  <p>We encourage members to use the following priority list:</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>Ask the offending member to stop the behavior. </li>
    <li>Put that player on mute and or ignore</li>
    <li>Seek mediation from an officer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If an issue arises that cannot be resolved by yourself, we ask that you act in a dignified manner and allow the leadership of the guild to hand out any reprimands if required.</p>
  <p>If you have a problem with one of the officers, please report it to another officer promptly. This includes situations wherein an officer makes you uncomfortable or appears to be violating the rules of the guild for any reason. We strive for transparency and accountability, but we don't always succeed; let us know if we make mistakes so we can correct them in the future.</p>
  


<h2 class="center rank">Punishments</h2>

  <p>Violating the rules of the guild is something that we take seriously, as it can lead to hard feelings and damage overall group cohesion. In the event that someone is violating the rules of the guild, we will investigate the matter and take appropriate action, whether the player in question is an officer or not.</p>
  <p>In the event that someone is behaving contrary to the rules, the first step is a discussion with the player in question and a notification that there is a problem. No further action will be taken, and if nothing else happens within a month the entire thing can be forgotten. *exceptions below</p>
  <p>A separate or continuing incident requires further steps. Someone who is consistently behaving contrary to the guild rules will be assigned a probationary rank with limited privileges for a month's time pending any further behavior violations. Further behavior issues will be dealt with via removal from the guild.</p>
  <p>The following behaviors will result in immediate removal from the guild with no exception. You will not be eligible to rejoin at any time.</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>Discrimination or slander based on race, gender, religion, sexual preference or anything that is not accepted in real life.</li>
    <li>Selling items from the guild bank on the auction house.</li>
    <li>Scamming other players including nonguild members.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 class="center rank">Guild Bank</h2>
                <article>
                  <p>The guild vault is used to store and share items beneficial to the guild.</p>
                    <ul class="list">
                     
                      <li> <strong>Standard Items:</strong> Potions, glyphs, profession materials, etc - Members are free to deposit or withdraw any items that would be of use to themselves or the guild. Members are expected to deposit 50% of the auction house price in gold or items of equivalent value when making withdrawals.</li>
                      <li> <strong> Reserved Items:</strong> Enchanting shards, BoE epic items, feasts, raid crafting reagents, etc - These items can be purchased for gold from the guild bank by request on the forum.</li>
                      <li>The guild bank will also be used to store materials for (and possibly already-crafted) feasts and flasks/cauldrons for use during guild raids.</li>
                      <li>Active raiders are expected to regularly contribute materials for the supply of guild feasts and/or flasks during raids. Active raiders who do not contribute will be demoted until they do so.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>
                  
                <h2 class="center rank">Leaving Xenocide</h2>
                <article>
                    <ul class="list">
                      <li>If a player finds that the guild is no longer a good fit for him or her, they should contact the officers  to discuss the situation. If officers can address the situation, they should be given the opportunity to do so. If they cannot, then we wish you the best as you look to find another home.</li>
                      <li>If a player is intending to make an application to another guild, it should be discussed with officers prior to making the application. After making the application the player should leave the guild - Xenocide is not your backup option.</li>
                      <li>Leaving the guild without following these rules will mean it is unlikely that any subsequent re-application would be successful.</li>
                      <li>The officers can dismiss any player for gross violation of guild rules or code of conduct.</li>
                      <li>Players who have left the guild on good terms can return to the guild without prejudice and possibly skipping some or all of the usual process. However, repeated guild hopping in and out of Xenocide will not be tolerated. Players who have been dismissed from the guild and seek to reapply will be handled on a case by case basis.</li>
